# A6: Indexes, triggers, user functions, transactions and population

Our product is a social network that allows users to create new relationships, making it easier to share moments with friends, and connecting people in a fun way.

This artefact contains the physical schema of the database, the identification and characterization of the indexes, the support of data integrity rules with triggers, the definition of the database user-defined functions, and the identification and characterization of the database transactions. This artefact also includes the complete database creation script, including all SQL necessary to define all integrity constraints, indexes, and triggers.

## 1. Database Workload

## 2. Proposed Indexes

Indexes are used to enhance database performance by allowing the database server to find and retrieve specific rows much faster. An index defined on a column that is part of a join condition can also significantly speed up queries with joins. Moreover, indexes can also benefit UPDATE and DELETE commands with search conditions.

The indexes proposed in the next section took in good consideration the impact on updates in the workload.

### 2.1. Performance Indexes

| **Index**           | IDX01                                  |
| ---                 | ---                                    |
| **Related queries** | SELECT01, SELECT02, SELECT07, SELECT11 |
| **Relation**        | post    |
| **Attribute**       | content_date  |
| **Type**            | B-tree              |
| **Cardinality**     | High |
| **Clustering**      | No |
| **Justification**   | Both the post searching and the news feed are crucial features that will be run very often, and they always use the date for ordering or condition. The table is also very large, and this index will improve performance on those queries. B-tree is chosen as inequality operators are used. Cardinality is high because virtually all dates will be different, so not a good candidate for clustering.  |
```sql
CREATE INDEX content_date ON content USING btree(content_date);
```

| **Index**           | IDX02                                  |
| ---                 | ---                                    |
| **Related queries** | SELECT02 |
| **Relation**        | post    |
| **Attribute**       | likes  |
| **Type**            | B-tree |
| **Cardinality**     | medium |
| **Clustering**      | No |
| **Justification**   | Unauthenticated users receive their feed based on their amount of likes, so for the same reason as above, it needs to perform quickly. Cardinality is medium, since it's likely many posts will have the same amount of likes. It has potential for clustering but another index had much higher priority. |
```sql
CREATE INDEX content_likes ON content USING btree(likes);
```

| **Relation**        | post    |
| **Attribute**       | author_id  |
| **Type**            | Hash |
| **Cardinality**     | medium |
| **Clustering**      | Yes |
| **Justification**   | author_id is a very requested attribute by the SELECT queries, either for joining tables or for looking if it has a friend. Hash index would be technically preferred, but this postgres version does not recommend it. Cardinality is medium, so it's a great candidate for clustering. |
```sql
CREATE INDEX content_author ON content USING btree(author_id);

| **Type**            | Hash |
| **Cardinality**     | medium |
| **Clustering**      | Yes |
| **Justification**   | The message table is very large and the sender and receiver ids are always part of the queries. Cardinality is medium, so it's a great candidate for clustering. |
```sql
CREATE INDEX message_sender ON message USING btree(sender_id);

| **Cardinality**     | medium |
| **Clustering**      | No |
| **Justification**   | The message table is very large and the sender and receiver ids are always part of the queries. Cardinality is medium, so it's a great candidate for clustering, but there can only be one clustered index. |
```sql
CREATE INDEX message_receiver ON message USING btree(receiver_id);

| **Clustering**      | No         |
| **Justification**   | The message table is very large and very often queried. The results must be ordered by the date sent, so we can get the most recent messages. As such creating an index for message dates will greatly improve performance |

| **Type**            | GiST |

## 4. Transactions
 
Transactions needed to assure the integrity of the data.

| T01   | Content insertion                    |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Justification   | In order to keep the complete generalisation of the "content" table consistent, any time we insert a new content, we must insure both the entries in the "content" table and the respective "post"/"comment" table are completed. It has an isolation level of REPEATABLE READ so that the currval of the content_id isn't changed.  |
| Isolation level | REPEATABLE READ |
```sql
--Add post
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
-- Insert content
 INSERT INTO content VALUES (DEFAULT, $user_id, $content, NOW(), 0, 0);
-- Insert post
 INSERT INTO post VALUES (currval('content_content_id_seq'), $private);
-- Insert post rule connection
 INSERT INTO post_rule VALUES ($rule_id, currval('content_content_id_seq'));
COMMIT;

--Add comment
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
-- Insert content
 INSERT INTO content VALUES (DEFAULT, $user_id, $content, NOW(), 0, 0);
-- Insert post
 INSERT INTO comment VALUES (currval('content_content_id_seq'), $post_id);
COMMIT;
```

---

| T02   | Friend request accept                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Justification   | To ensure that, if the insertion into the friend table doesn't happen, the friend request is recovered. The isolation level is REPEATABLE READ because we want to ensure that once the friend request is deleted, no other transaction tries to insert it back before the friends table is updated. |
| Isolation level | REPEATABLE READ |
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
-- Delete friend Request from friend_request Table
 DELETE FROM friend_request WHERE user_from = $user_from AND user_to = $user_to;
-- Insert into friends
 INSERT INTO friend VALUES ($user_from, $user_to);
COMMIT;
```

---

| T03   | Insert notification                |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Justification   | Similarly to the content generalisation, to ensure the consistency of the database we must make sure both inserts into the "notification" table and the respective "notification_user"/"notification_content" table are completed. It has an isolation level of REPEATABLE READ so that the currval of the notification id isn't changed.|
| Isolation level | REPEATABLE READ |
```sql
-- add user notification
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
-- Insert notification
 INSERT INTO notification VALUES (DEFAULT, $user_to, NOW(), $description);
-- Insert notification_user
 INSERT INTO notification_user VALUES (currval('notification_notification_id_seq'), $user_from);
COMMIT;

-- add content notification
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
-- Insert notification
 INSERT INTO notification VALUES (DEFAULT, $user, NOW(), $description);
-- Insert notification_content
